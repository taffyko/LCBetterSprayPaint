# Features & Usage
NOTE: All players must have the same version of the mod installed to play together.

NOTE: In the unmodded base game, not all geometry is fully paintable.
I've done what I can to make more of the game paintable, but there's no way to reliably fix this everywhere.
**The placement preview projection will not be displayed on unpaintable surfaces.**

## Improved painting & eraser
- Several changes/bugfixes that make spraypaint work more consistently, look better, and feel better to use
	- Certain spots in levels may still be unpaintable (due to invisible colliders). It remains to be seen if this can be fixed in the future.
- You can now erase! (By default: press `E` + `LMB` at the same time)  
	(can be disabled in config by lobby host)

## Color control
Colors sync properly, and players can **change** the color of their spray paint! (default key: `T`)  
(can be disabled by lobby host)

## Size control
You can now control the **size** of your spray paint (default keys: `+` and `-` on number row)  
(maximum size can be configured by lobby host)
